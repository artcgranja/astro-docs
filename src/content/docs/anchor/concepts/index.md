    why "just stuff it in the prompt" doesn't scale.

-   :material-sitemap:{ .lg .middle } **Architecture**

    ---

    The 6-stage pipeline that transforms a raw query into a fully assembled,
    token-budgeted context window.

-   :material-puzzle:{ .lg .middle } **Protocols**

    ---

    PEP 544 structural subtyping for every extension point -- bring your own
    retriever, memory, formatter, or store without inheriting a base class.

-   :material-chart-donut:{ .lg .middle } **Token Budgets**

    ---

    Per-source allocation, overflow tracking, and priority-based eviction to
    keep your context window within model limits.
